Many eastern cities had community baseball teams, and rich people began to pay players to play for their teams. These teams grew and started playing one another, and eventually formed into two leagues: The American League and the National League.\n\nRecent World Champions\n\n2010: San Francisco Giants\n2011: St. Louis Cardinals\n2012: San Francisco Giants\n2013: Boston Red Sox\n2014: San Francisco Giants\n2015: Kansas City Royals\n2016: Chicago Cubs\n2017: Houston Astos\n2018: Boston Red Sox\n2019: Washington Nationals\n2020: LA Dodgers\n2021: Atlanta Braves\n2022: Houston Astros"

This was due to the fact that interleague play, or matchups between the two leagues, was an uncommon occurrence and all interleague matchups were scheduled for the same dates. The Houston Astros joined the American League in 2013, and now interleague play is held throughout the season."
